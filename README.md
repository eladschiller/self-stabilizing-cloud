# Self-stabilizing Cloud Technologies 

This repository includes a collection of evaluation pilots for self-stabilizing algorithms that can serve as building blocks for fault-tolerant Cloud systems. We view this collection of work as the first steps in developing efficient (i) self-stabilizing cloud storage based on atomic coded shared memory emulation and (ii) self-stabilizing Byzantine fault-tolerant replicated state-machine services.

These pilot were developed during Chalmers master-level degree projects that were jointly supervised by faculties from Chalmers University of Technology and University of Cyprus.

## Self-stabilization overhead: a case study on coded atomic storage

This project was developed by Robert Gustafsson and Andreas Lindh√©. It proceedings version is to appear in NETYS 2019.

## Implementing Self-stabilizing Byzantine Fault-tolerant State-machine Replication (a Proof of Concept, Validation and Preliminary Evaluation)

This project was developed by Axel Niklasson and Therese Petersson.
